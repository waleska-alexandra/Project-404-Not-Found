## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/waleska-alexandra/Project-404-Not-Found/blob/main/project.png)

This was an great challenge for newbie front end developer like me. Obviously, if you have many experience, this one could be very easy and unnecessary.
I was able to improve things like responsive design and I had my first meet with Figma. I think this was a great opportunity. 
I finished this project with more knowledge about HTML and CSS.
